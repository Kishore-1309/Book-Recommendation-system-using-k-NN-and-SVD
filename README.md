# Book-Recommendation-system-using-k-NN-and-SVD
This project proposes a hybrid recommendation approach to enhance recommendation quality without necessitating novel prediction algorithms. Specifically, we integrate k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) algorithms with collaborative filtering's matrix factorization technique, employing singular value decomposition (SVD).
